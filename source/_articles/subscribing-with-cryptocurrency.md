This article guides you through the different options you have to subscribe using a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, Monero or Ethereum.

## How it works

AnonAddy uses [NOWPayments](https://nowpayments.io/) to process cryptocurrency payments.

NOWPayments supports many cryptocurrencies including:

- BTC (Bitcoin)
- XMR (Monero)
- LTC (Litecoin)
- DOGE (Dogecoin)
- DCR (Decred)
- ETH (Ethereum)
- XRP (Ripple)

For a full list of supported coins [click here](https://nowpayments.io/supported-coins). There are some limitations such as a minimum invoice value of $10, so at the moment you can only pay with cryptocurrency for a yearly plan.

If you'd prefer for your cryptocurrency payment to be processed manually then please [contact](/contact/) me for further instructions.
