Bitwarden integrates AnonAddy allowing you to create aliases with ease.

## Bitwarden + AnonAddy

I'm extremely excited to announce that [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) has added AnonAddy integration with their latest update. It is now available within the Bitwarden desktop application, browser extensions, and Bitwarden web vault. Mobile application support is planned in a future release.

An email alias service like AnonAddy helps protect users’ privacy online, which makes us highly complementary to a password management service like Bitwarden.

## What is Bitwarden?

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is an open source password manager used by millions around the world. Bitwarden helps you generate, save, and manage your logins safely and securely. You can also share secure information easily with others in your organization.

Password managers secure and protect your online data in the face of rising cybercrime threats.

If you don't have a Bitwarden account you can [create one](https://vault.bitwarden.com/#/register?layout=default) for free.

## What will this mean for AnonAddy users?

If you use Bitwarden and AnonAddy it will mean that you will now be able to create email aliases for AnonAddy directly from the [Bitwarden Generator](https://bitwarden.com/help/generator/#generate-a-username).

This will make it extremely quick and convenient to create and save alias details directly in Bitwarden for each account.

> "Using a unique email alias, username, and password for every account provides the ultimate defense against data breaches and strong privacy protection. With this new integration into Bitwarden, it’s easier than ever to keep your accounts and online identity secure." - Bitwarden
