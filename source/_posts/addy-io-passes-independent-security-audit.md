Although addy.io has always been open-source, I wanted to offer users even more transparency by having an unbiased third-party company conduct an in-depth review of the service.

I'm delighted to announce that addy.io has passed an independent security audit carried out by Securitum including a web application penetration test and a source code audit.

## What is a security audit?

> A security audit is an independent analysis of an organisationâ€™s security posture to identify any weaknesses or vulnerabilities.

Part of the security audit carried out involved a penetration test (pentest), which is a proactive and authorised simulated cyberattack on a web application, aimed at identifying and fixing potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.

A combination of automated and manual techniques are used to identify vulnerabilities.

The security audit also involved an analysis of the source code for the web application ([https://app.addy.io](https://app.addy.io/)).

The goal is to provide insights into the service's security status and recommend ways to improve security of the web application.

## Who performed the audit?

The security audit was carried out by [Securitum](https://www.securitum.com), a leading european penetration testing company.

## What were the results?

The results were extremely positive and I'm very happy with the report!

> During testing, no significant vulnerabilities were identified. Low-risk vulnerabilities were reported, as well as several informational points.

The 2 low-risk issues have been fixed and the informational points have also been addressed. This has been confirmed by a retest as shown in the report.
