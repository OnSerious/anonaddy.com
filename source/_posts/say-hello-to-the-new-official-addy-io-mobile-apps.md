## What's new?

I'm excited to announce some **big updates** that will improve your experience with addy.io! Over the past few months **[Stjin](https://twitter.com/Stjinchan)** (the developer of the existing Android app) has been hard at work bringing some fantastic new features to life. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new:

#### Brand New Official addy.io iOS App üéâ

I'm thrilled to introduce the brand new **[addy.io iOS and iPadOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/addy-io/id6563138633)**! For the first time ever, addy.io users on Apple devices can enjoy an **official app experience**. Whether you're using an iPhone or an iPad, this app offers a sleek, user-friendly interface that makes managing your aliases a breeze.

This app brings a lot of the great features users love from the Android version, but optimised specifically for iOS and iPadOS with a smooth and intuitive design, all thanks to SwiftUI. Best of all, it's free for all addy.io users!

#### Official addy.io Android App

In addition to launching the iOS app, I'm proud to announce that Stjin‚Äôs existing **[addy.io Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.stjin.anonaddy)** is now the **official app** for all Android users. Stjin has been working hard to ensure both apps provide a cohesive experience across platforms, and now you can access the same fantastic features on both iOS and Android, completely free of charge!

You can also download the app from **[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/host.stjin.anonaddy)**.

#### Open Source for Both Apps

One of the most exciting aspects of this collaboration is that the source code for both the iOS and Android apps has now been consolidated under the **[addy.io GitHub organisation](https://github.com/anonaddy)**. We believe in transparency and community collaboration, and by making the code open-source, we're encouraging developers to contribute and help us continue to improve the apps.

#### Browser Extension Now Available for Edge and Safari

As part of our continued effort to make addy.io more accessible, the browser extension is now also available for **[Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/addyio-anonymous-email/ohjlgpcfncgkijjfmabldlgnccmgcehl)** and **[Apple Safari](https://apps.apple.com/app/addy-io-extension/id6670220050)**. The extension makes it even easier to manage your aliases while browsing, and I'll continue to roll out updates and improvements in the coming months.

## What Does This Mean for You?

Whether you‚Äôre a long-time addy.io user or just getting started, here‚Äôs a quick recap of the key features across both apps, as detailed by [Stjin](https://old.reddit.com/r/addy_io/comments/1fwlegb/addyio_for_ios_ipados_is_here/):

- **Free of Charge**: Both the Android and iOS Official addy.io apps will be available for free for all users.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Both apps feature intuitive and easy-to-navigate designs, making it simple for you to find what you need.

- **Customisation Options**: Personalise your app experience with custom icons and configurable widgets.

- **Seamless Integration**: Both apps integrate smoothly with their respective platforms, offering features like the iOS app‚Äôs exclusive sharing sheet integration or the Android app's notifications for expiring subscriptions and failed deliveries.

- **SwiftUI Design (iOS)**: Built with SwiftUI, the iOS app is not only beautiful but also highly optimised for performance.

- **Exclusive Content**: Enjoy unique features like the "watch-alias" feature on both platforms, as well as app-specific content and notifications.

- **Siri & Shortcuts (iOS)**: On iOS, there is also a powerful new Siri & Shortcuts feature, allowing you to automate alias creation with ease. Whether it‚Äôs triggering actions via the iPhone 15 Pro‚Äôs Action Button or the Apple Pencil Pro's Squeeze Feature, this integration brings a whole new level of convenience.

We're excited for you to try them out!
